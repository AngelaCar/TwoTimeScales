Description: Tools for the analysis of time to event data with two time scales. The main goal of the analysis is to estimate a smooth hazard that varies over two time scales and also, if covariates are available, to estimate a proportional hazards model with such a two-dimensional baseline hazard. Functions are provided to prepare the raw data for estimation, to estimate and to plot the two-dimensional smooth hazard.
Additionally, the cumulative incidence functions over two time scales can be estimated in a competing risks model.
