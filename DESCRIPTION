Description: A collection of functions for the analysis of time to event data with two time scales.
    The main goal of the analysis is to estimate a smooth two dimensional hazard curve, while also respecting the constraint imposed by the relation between the two time scales.
    Analyses are based on the P-splines model of Poisson data with offset. Regression model to study the effect of covariates on the baseline hazard are possible in a proportional hazards fashion. 
    Functions to plot the (baseline) hazard are also provided.
