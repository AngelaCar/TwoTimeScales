Description: Analyse time to event data with two time scales by estimating a smooth hazard that varies over two time scales. If covariates are available, estimate a proportional hazards model with such a two-dimensional baseline hazard. 
  Functions are provided to prepare the raw data for estimation, to estimate and to plot the two-dimensional smooth hazard. 
  Extension to a competing risks model are implemented. For details about the method please refer to Carollo et al. (2024) <doi:10.1002/sim.10297>.
