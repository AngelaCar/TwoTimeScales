# TwoTimeScales

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

`TwoTimeScales` provides a suite of functions for the analysis of time to event data with two time scales.

The package provides tools to estimate a smooth hazard that varies over two time scales and also, if covariates are available, to estimate a proportional hazards model with such a two-dimensional baseline hazard. The hazard of one event is modelled by means of two-dimensional P-splines model of Poisson data with offset. Regression model to study the effect of covariates on the baseline hazard are possible in a proportional hazards fashion. Functions to plot the (baseline) hazard are also provided.

Additionally, functions to estimate cumulated surfaces (such as cumulated hazard, survival function and incidence function) over two time scales are included.

## Installation
### From CRAN
Just run install.packages("TwoTimeScales")

### From GitHub
You can install the development version of TwoTimeScales from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AngelaCar/TwoTimeScales")
```
Vignettes need to be explicitly requested. To install a version of the package
including the vignettes, please run:

``` r
devtools::install_github("AngelaCar/TwoTimeScales",
                          dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
Note: This will take more time than installing the version of the package without vignettes.
Alternatively, we suggest to read the vignettes online here: 
[TwoTimeScales](https://angelacar.github.io/TwoTimeScales/)

## How to use TwoTimeScales

A general introduction to the usage of the package is given in:

``` r
vignette("TwoTimeScales")
```
or here [Introduction](https://angelacar.github.io/TwoTimeScales/articles/TwoTimeScales.html).

Further examples on can be found in the vignettes.

``` r
vignette("onetime")
vignette("twotimes")
vignette("visualization")
```
